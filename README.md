Project: Investigating Respresentations of Identity that Exist on Distributed Platforms 

* rapid initial prototype: replicate existing work in Mind the Machine to apply to a different source of input
* longer-term: generalize algorithm to be able to learn procedural level representations of a creator's identity from different sources of input (words/poetry? sketches? behavioral tasks?) 
* explore legal aspects of the project
* workshop/talk at Media Lab?  
* mass-participation?
