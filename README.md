**Project: Investigating Respresentations of Identity that Exist on Distributed Platforms**

* rapid initial prototype: replicate existing work in Mind the Machine to apply to a different source of input
* longer-term: generalize algorithm to be able to learn procedural level representations of a creator's identity from different sources of input (words/poetry? sketches? behavioral tasks?) 
* explore [legal aspects](https://github.com/mitmedialab/DistributedIdentity/tree/master/docs/Legal) of the project
* workshop/talk at Media Lab?  
* mass-participation?
