Starter list for legal aspect of this project.

* Right of Publicity: http://rightofpublicity.com/brief-history-of-rop

* Add property rights and other standards stuff and explore other paradigms tuned to the non-corporeal and inter-personal dimensions of ownership and identity

* For rapid initial prototype, use practical open source and creative commons automated tooling such as the Google Form license gate for MIT Legal Hackathons and cross-linked, auto-populating legal agreements, licenses and other materials from other parts of the project (eg using commits to identify "collaborators" for auto-listing "credit and attribution" etc). 

* Hold lightweight lightnight talks/breakout sessions or workshop type thing at Media Lab to elicit engagement and input/feedback from technology, legal and entreprenuerial, science, policy and other thought leaders

* Consider a quick-and-dirty mock trial to test the efficacy of our ideas for how to do this in a good way 

* Consider a mass-participation contribution process for later work (ie with many artists and data scientists and galleries and schools and such)
